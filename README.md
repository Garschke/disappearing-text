# disappearing-text
A Python and Tkinter-based desktop application designed to help authors with writers block.<br> Once you start the app you can select a prompt if desired (optional) and a session time out (again optional - default is set to 15 seconds), you can begin typing. <br>
Onve you gave started, if you do not keep typing, then after the selected session time out, number of seconds of inactivity allowed, the text will be deleted. As a warning indication, 10 seconds before the time out the text begins to fade. The app has a selection of starting prompts saved in a text file, which it can randomly serve up as inspiration to start writing.

Selecting the session time out, (by clicking on the text above the 'Start Writing' button), and generating a random prompt, (by clicking on the 'Generate Prompt' button).

Using the 'Don't stop writing' window in the app, as long as you keep typing, then the text remains visible. But if you stop typing, then after a time the text will slowly dim and vanish when the Time Out is reached! An interactive Word count is displayed at the bottom of the screen, and count down timer at the top.

3. If you decide to go for a prompt, when you click the prompt button you will be provide with an opening piece of text, you can either go with that or press the prompt button again for a new opening prompt.

4. With either an opening prompt or a blank canvas you then click on the start writing button to take you to the text entry screen.
